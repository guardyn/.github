# 🔒 Guardyn

**Privacy-First. Secure by Design. Open by Default.**

Guardyn is building the next generation of end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) messaging infrastructure that puts security and privacy at its core. Built with Rust for memory safety and deployed on Kubernetes for scalability, Guardyn ensures your communications remain truly private.

## 🛡️ Our Mission

We believe privacy is a fundamental right, not a luxury. Guardyn is committed to:

- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: We can't read your messages, even if we wanted to
- **Open Source Transparency**: All our code is open for security audits
- **Modern Cryptography**: Leveraging state-of-the-art E2EE protocols
- **Memory Safety First**: Built in Rust to eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities

## 🚀 Core Technologies

- **Rust** - Memory-safe systems programming for security-critical components
- **Kubernetes** - Cloud-native orchestration for scalable, resilient infrastructure
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** - Cryptographic guarantees for privacy
- **Signal Protocol** - Battle-tested E2EE messaging protocol
